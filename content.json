			,"story":"After repeated failed attempts to get the text-destructive animation just right, I was approached to create this animation. I worked directly with the ad publisher and nytimes.com to make sure that this home-page takeover ad performed perfectly."
			,"process":"Animation created in Adobe Flash with ActionScript code for the vendor's custom ad server code. Files uploaded to FTP server for delivery to outside vendor for deployment."
			,"results":"The attention to detail in this animation, the ability to get up to speed quickly, and work well within the newyorktimes.com submissions guideline, and finally, the quick turnaround on my portion of this project solidified me as a go to designer/developer for the Canon team at Grey New York. This led to my role in future projects as a Creative Technologist."

For this project, I created the logo and the site design, then coded the static site that was then passed to the Shopify/Magento developer to add the ecommerce code."
			,"process":"Layout in Adobe InDesign with retouching in Photoshop. Convert approved designs into HTML and CSS. Handoff final coded layouts to back-end developer to incorporate Shopify ecommerce functionality."
			,"results":"The fun and versatile logo inspired new uses on the physical product; from labels and stamps to plans of a stuffed, plush toy. The website design immediately led to sales and was featured in press for the company."
